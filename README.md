# AHN Severity Stratification  

This repository contains the codes for our study involving an end-to-end deep machine learning framework developed to sequentially detect ultrasound regions of interest, segment kidneys from US images, and classify Antenatal or Prenatal Hydronephrosis (AHN) severity.  

## Kidney Segmentation: Phase 1

In this phase, we segment or localize the kidney regions from preprocessed Ultrasound (US) images using 2D-segmentation networks e.g., UNet.

## AHN Severity Classification: Phase 2

In this phase, we classify the severity of AHN based on segmented kidney regions from Phase 1.
